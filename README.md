This repository contains contains code from an initial attempt to use
Bayesian methods to guess at the original death counts, using deaths
data that have been randomly rounded to base 3. The guesses are informed
by (i) a model of the underlying mortality rates, and (ii) a
mathematical description of the random-rounding process. For more on the
theory, see Chapter 14 of the book [Bayesian Demographic Estimation and
Forecasting](www.bdef-book.com).
