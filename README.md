This repository contains contains code from an experiment with using
Bayesian methods to derive unrounded death counts from deaths counts
that have been randomly rounded to base 3. The estimates are informed by
(i) a model of the underlying mortality rates, and (ii) a mathematical
description of the random-rounding process. For more on the theory, see
Chapter 14 of [Bayesian Demographic Estimation and
Forecasting](https://www.bdef-book.com).
